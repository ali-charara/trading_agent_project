# Trading Agent Project

This project for the Reinforcement Learning course at CentraleSup√©lec consists of the implementation of trading agents on a stock market environment. We aim at reproducing the pipeline of [Deep Reinforcement Learning for Automated Stock Trading: An Ensemble Strategy](<https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3690996>).

## Execution

To execute this project, you might have a look at `training_pipeline.ipynb` containing a script running the training as well as the evaluation pipelines on a market of interest. The `constants.py` might be modified to customize the pipeline to your specific usecase.
